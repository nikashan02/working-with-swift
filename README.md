# working with swift
 Collection of my progress in Grade 11 for my co-op with Apple where I learned how to develop applications using Swift and the XCode environment. Thanks a lot to @jbyung for mentoring me throughout this process. This same repository can be found in the Meadowvale secondary school organization that I am a part of.
